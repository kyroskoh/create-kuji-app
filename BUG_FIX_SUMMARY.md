# Bug Fix Summary - Navigation Links Not Showing

## Date
2025-10-06

## Issue
After setting a permanent username, navigation links (Draw, Manage, Account) were not showing in the header, and users got stuck on the `/account` page when trying to access other routes.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing `emailVerified` Field in API Response
**File**: `server/src/controllers/authController.ts`

The `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint was missing the `emailVerified` field that the frontend expected.

- During **login/signup**: API returned `emailVerified: user.emails[0]?.verifiedAt !== null`
- During **getCurrentUser**: API only returned the `emails` array, NOT the `emailVerified` boolean
- Frontend's `RequireSetup` component checked `if (!user.emailVerified)` which evaluated to `true` (falsy) when the field was missing, causing redirect loops

**Fix**: Added `emailVerified` field to the response (line 495)

```typescript
return res.status(200).json({
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    displayName: user.displayName,
    usernameSetByUser: user.usernameSetByUser,
    emailVerified: user.emails[0]?.verifiedAt !== null, // ✅ ADDED
    emails: user.emails,
    providers: user.providerAccounts,
    isSuperAdmin: user.isSuperAdmin,
    createdAt: user.createdAt,
    lastLogin: user.lastLogin
  }
});
```

### 2. Property Name Mismatch - `loading` vs `isLoading`
**Files**: 
- `src/components/AuthenticatedHome.jsx`
- `src/components/UserRoutes.jsx`

The `AuthContext` exported `loading` but components were trying to use `isLoading`, causing the app to never properly detect when authentication finished loading.

**Fix**: Changed `isLoading` to `loading` in both files

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `server/src/controllers/authController.ts` - Added `emailVerified` to API response
2. ✅ `src/components/AuthenticatedHome.jsx` - Fixed `isLoading` → `loading`
3. ✅ `src/components/UserRoutes.jsx` - Fixed `isLoading` → `loading`
4. ✅ `src/components/MainLayout.jsx` - Added/removed debug logging (cleanup)
5. ✅ `src/utils/AuthContext.jsx` - Added/removed debug logging (cleanup)

## Solution Steps

1. Fixed the API response structure to include `emailVerified`
2. Fixed property name mismatches throughout the frontend
3. Restarted both backend and frontend servers
4. Cleared browser cache to load updated code

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Navigation links not visible in header
- ❌ Stuck on `/account` page after setting username
- ❌ Could not access `/draw`, `/manage`, or other routes
- ❌ User object had `emailVerified: undefined`

### After Fix
- ✅ Navigation links visible in header (Draw, Manage, Account)
- ✅ Can navigate between all pages freely
- ✅ No redirect loops
- ✅ User object properly includes `emailVerified: true/false`

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **API Contract Documentation**: Document the expected user object shape across all endpoints
2. **Consistent Property Names**: Use the same property names throughout the codebase
3. **TypeScript**: Consider migrating frontend to TypeScript to catch property name mismatches at compile time
4. **Unit Tests**: Add tests that verify API response structures
5. **Integration Tests**: Add E2E tests for the complete user setup flow
