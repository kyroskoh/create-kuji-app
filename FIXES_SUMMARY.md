# Authentication and Routing Fixes Summary

## Issue
When logging in as "demo" and navigating to `/demo/manage`, refreshing the page would redirect to `/demo/stock` instead of staying on `/demo/manage`.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Login Redirect Logic**: `Login.jsx` was redirecting users to `/{username}/stock` instead of `/{username}/manage`
2. **Relative Route Redirect**: `UserRoutes.jsx` had a relative redirect that could cause routing issues
3. **Authentication Initialization**: Potential race conditions during auth initialization on page refresh

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Login Redirects (`src/pages/Login.jsx`)
- **Line 23**: Changed redirect from `/${user.username}/stock` to `/${user.username}/manage`
- **Line 46**: Changed redirect from `/${result.user.username}/stock` to `/${result.user.username}/manage`

**Impact**: Users will now be redirected to their manage page after login instead of stock page.

### 2. Fixed Relative Redirect (`src/components/UserRoutes.jsx`)
- **Line 89**: Changed `to="manage"` to `to="./manage"` to ensure proper relative path resolution

**Impact**: Default user route redirect will work correctly.

### 3. Added Debug Logging (`src/components/UserRoutes.jsx`)
- Added comprehensive logging to `ValidateUserAccess` component to track:
  - URL username
  - Authenticated user
  - Loading state
  - Access grant/deny decisions
  - Redirect actions

**Impact**: Easier debugging of authentication and routing issues.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Log in as "demo" user
   - Verify redirect goes to `/demo/manage`
   - Check console for any errors

2. **Test Page Refresh**:
   - Navigate to `/demo/manage`
   - Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Verify URL stays at `/demo/manage`
   - Check console logs for authentication flow

3. **Test Authentication Persistence**:
   - Log in
   - Close browser tab
   - Open new tab and navigate to `/demo/manage`
   - Verify authentication persists

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ‚úÖ Login redirects to `/demo/manage` for regular users
- ‚úÖ Page refresh at `/demo/manage` stays at `/demo/manage`
- ‚úÖ Authentication persists across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ Access control validates correctly
- ‚úÖ Console logs show clear authentication flow

## Additional Notes

- The auth initialization logging added in previous fixes will help identify any timing issues
- React StrictMode causes double initialization in development - this is expected behavior
- The `isInitialized` state guard prevents duplicate auth calls

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/Login.jsx` - Fixed login redirect destinations
2. `src/components/UserRoutes.jsx` - Fixed relative redirect and added debug logging
3. `src/components/AuthenticatedHome.jsx` - Previously fixed to redirect to manage
4. `src/utils/AuthContext.jsx` - Previously added initialization guards and logging
5. `src/utils/api.js` - Previously fixed token clearing to preserve kuji data

## Console Log Examples

When refresh works correctly, you should see:
```
üåê API Base URL: http://localhost:3001/api
üîÑ Initializing auth...
Tokens found: {object}
üìû Fetching current user from API...
‚úì Successfully restored authentication for: demo
‚öôÔ∏è Auth initialization complete, loading = false
üîç ValidateUserAccess - URL: demo, User: demo, Loading: false
‚úÖ Access granted to demo for user demo
```

If redirect occurs, logs will show:
```
‚ùå ValidateUserAccess - No user, redirecting to login
```
or
```
‚ùå Access denied: {username} cannot access {urlUsername}'s page, redirecting to /{username}/manage
```
