# Setup Complete! ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. Created WARP.md Documentation
- Comprehensive development commands for frontend and backend
- Architecture overview explaining the LocalForage-centric state management
- Weight & probability system documentation
- Tier color system details
- Development workflows for common tasks

### 2. Fixed Prisma Client Issue
- Generated Prisma client with `npm run prisma:generate`
- Updated all documentation to emphasize this critical step

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Copied `.env.example` to `.env` in server directory
- Configured SQLite database URL: `file:./dev.db`
- Set development-friendly defaults for email and hCaptcha (optional in dev)

### 4. Database Setup
- Ran migrations (database already in sync)
- Verified seed data (super admin and demo user already exist)

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Updated root `README.md` with Prisma generate step
- Updated `server/README.md` with detailed Prisma client instructions
- Corrected database references from PostgreSQL to SQLite for development
- Added troubleshooting notes for common errors

## Backend Server is Ready! 🎉

The server successfully started on port 3001:
```
🚀 Create Kuji Server running on port 3001
📊 Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
🌍 Environment: development
```

## Quick Start Commands

### Start Backend (from server/ directory)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start Frontend (from root directory)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Credentials
- **Demo User**: username `demo`, password `Demo123!`
- **Super Admin**: username `kyroskoh`, email `kyroskoh@example.com`, password `Admin123!`

## Database Location
- **File**: `C:\Users\k.koh\dev\create-kuji-app\server\dev.db`
- **Type**: SQLite (development)

## Important Notes

1. **Prisma Client**: Always run `npm run prisma:generate` after changing `schema.prisma`
2. **Environment**: All development environment variables are pre-configured
3. **Email**: Uses Ethereal test accounts automatically (check console for preview URLs)
4. **hCaptcha**: Skipped in development mode

## Next Steps

1. Start both servers (backend and frontend) in separate terminals
2. Visit `http://localhost:5173` for the full app
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173/demo` for demo mode without backend

Happy coding! 🚀
