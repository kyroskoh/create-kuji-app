# Demo User Permanent Username Setup

## Overview
Configured the demo user to have their username permanently set to "demo" to skip the "complete your profile" process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Seed Script
**File:** `server/src/utils/seed.ts`

Added `usernameSetByUser: true` when creating the demo user:

```typescript
const demoUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    username: demoUsername,
    displayName: 'Demo User',
    usernameSetByUser: true, // Mark as already set to skip profile completion
    isSuperAdmin: false,
    // ... rest of config
  }
});
```

### 2. Created Fix Script
**File:** `server/src/utils/fix-demo-username.ts`

Created a utility script to update existing demo users in the database.

**Script command:** `npm run fix:demo`

### 3. Updated Existing Demo User

Ran the fix script to update the current demo user:

```bash
npm run fix:demo
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Updated demo user:
   Username: demo
   UsernameSetByUser: true
   DisplayName: Demo User
🎉 Demo user is now permanently set!
```

## Demo User Configuration

The demo user now has:

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `username` | `demo` | Permanent username |
| `usernameSetByUser` | `true` | Skip profile completion |
| `displayName` | `Demo User` | Display name |
| `emailVerified` | `true` | Email verified |
| `password` | `Demo123!` | Login password |

## User Experience

### Before
```
Demo user logs in
    ↓
See "Complete Your Profile" prompt
    ↓
Must set username (but can't use "demo")
    ↓
Frustrated user
```

### After
```
Demo user logs in
    ↓
✅ Username already set to "demo"
    ↓
✅ Profile complete
    ↓
✅ Ready to use app immediately
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No Profile Prompt**: Demo user sees no "complete profile" message
2. ✅ **Permanent Username**: "demo" username is locked in
3. ✅ **Better UX**: Instant access to demo features
4. ✅ **Consistent State**: All new demo users will have this setup

## Exception Logic

The demo user still has special permissions via the double bypass we implemented:

```typescript
const isDemoUser = currentUser.username === 'demo';
const isSettingDemoUsername = lowerUsername === 'demo';

// Can re-set username to "demo" if needed (even though already set)
if (currentUser.usernameSetByUser && !(isDemoUser && isSettingDemoUsername)) {
  // Block other users
}
```

This means:
- ✅ Demo can keep/confirm "demo" username
- ❌ Other users cannot change once set
- ❌ Other users cannot use "demo"

## Future Demo Users

Any new demo users created via the seed script will automatically have:
- `usernameSetByUser: true`
- No profile completion required
- Immediate access to all features

## Commands

```bash
# Fix existing demo user
npm run fix:demo

# Re-seed database (creates demo with permanent username)
npm run prisma:seed

# Check demo user status
# (Use Prisma Studio or query directly)
```
