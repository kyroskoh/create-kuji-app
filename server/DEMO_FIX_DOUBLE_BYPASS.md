# Demo User Double Bypass Fix

## Issue
The demo user couldn't set their username to "demo" because they were blocked by the `usernameSetByUser` check (line 404-409).

Even though we added an exception for the reserved username check, the demo user still had `usernameSetByUser: true` from a previous attempt, which blocked them.

## Solution
Added a **second exception** to also bypass the `usernameSetByUser` check for the demo user.

### Code Change

**File:** `server/src/controllers/userController.ts`  
**Line:** 405

**Before:**
```typescript
if (currentUser.usernameSetByUser) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'USERNAME_ALREADY_SET',
    message: 'Username has already been set. Please contact support to change it.',
  });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Exception: Allow demo user to re-set 'demo' username
if (currentUser.usernameSetByUser && !(isDemoUser && isSettingDemoUsername)) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'USERNAME_ALREADY_SET',
    message: 'Username has already been set. Please contact support to change it.',
  });
}
```

## Result

Now the demo user bypasses **TWO** checks:

1. ✅ **Reserved Username Check** (line 396)
   - `if (reservedUsernames.includes(lowerUsername) && !(isDemoUser && isSettingDemoUsername))`
   
2. ✅ **Username Already Set Check** (line 405)
   - `if (currentUser.usernameSetByUser && !(isDemoUser && isSettingDemoUsername))`

## Testing

The demo user can now:
- ✅ Set their username to "demo" (bypasses reserved check)
- ✅ Re-set their username to "demo" even if already set (bypasses already-set check)
- ✅ Keep "demo" as their permanent username

Other users still:
- ❌ Cannot use "demo" (reserved username error)
- ❌ Cannot change username once set (already-set error)

## Flow Diagram

```
Demo user tries to set username to "demo"
    ↓
Check 1: Is reserved username?
    ↓
    YES → Is demo user setting "demo"? → YES → ✅ Allow (bypass)
    ↓
Check 2: Is username already set?
    ↓
    YES → Is demo user setting "demo"? → YES → ✅ Allow (bypass)
    ↓
✅ SUCCESS: Username updated to "demo"
```
