# Support Team Guide: Username Changes

## Overview
This guide explains how to change usernames for users who have already set their username (which is normally a one-time operation).

## Why This Script Is Needed

Users can only set their username **once** through the application. If they:
- Made a typo
- Want to rebrand
- Need to change for privacy reasons
- Have other legitimate reasons

The support team can use this script to bypass the one-time restriction and change their username.

## Script Command

```bash
npm run support:change-username <current-username> <new-username>
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Username Change
```bash
npm run support:change-username johndoe john_doe_official
```

### Example 2: Fixing a Typo
```bash
npm run support:change-username sarasmith sara_smith
```

### Example 3: Rebranding
```bash
npm run support:change-username oldname newbrandname
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Verify the Request
Before running the script, verify:
- ‚úÖ User has a valid reason for the change
- ‚úÖ User identity has been confirmed
- ‚úÖ New username meets requirements (see below)

### Step 2: Check Username Requirements
New username must:
- Be 5-20 characters long
- Only contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-)
- Not be a reserved username (see list below)
- Not already be taken by another user

### Step 3: Run the Script

Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

Run the command with current and new usernames:
```bash
npm run support:change-username <current> <new>
```

### Step 4: Verify the Change

The script will show:
```
üîß Support Script: Change Username

üìã Request Details:
   Current Username: johndoe
   New Username: john_official

‚úÖ Found user:
   ID: abc123

   Email: john@example.com
   Username Set By User: true
   Super Admin: false

‚úÖ Successfully updated username!

   New Username: john_official ‚ú®

```

### System Accounts (6)

**Total: 42 reserved usernames**

## Error Handling

### Error: User Not Found
```
‚ùå Error: User with username "johndoe" not found
```
**Solution:** Verify the current username is correct

### Error: Username Already Taken
```
‚ùå Error: Username "newname" is already taken by another user
   User ID: xyz789
```
**Solution:** Choose a different username

### Error: Reserved Username
```
‚ùå Error: "admin" is a reserved username and cannot be used
```
**Solution:** Choose a non-reserved username

### Error: Invalid Format
```
‚ùå Error: New username must be 5-20 characters and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
```
**Solution:** Fix the username format

## What Gets Updated

When you run this script, the following fields are updated:

| Field | Update |
|-------|--------|
| `username` | Changed to new username (lowercase) |
| `displayName` | Changed to new username |
| `usernameSetByUser` | Set to `true` |

**Note:** Email, password, and other data remain unchanged.

## Important Notes

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Confirmation Prompt**: The script runs immediately - double-check before running
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Username is Lowercased**: All usernames are stored in lowercase
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Display Name Matches**: Display name is automatically set to match the new username
4. ‚úÖ **Preserves Data**: All user data, prizes, settings, and history are preserved
5. ‚úÖ **User Routes Updated**: Routes like `/{username}/draw` will automatically use the new username

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ Script validates all inputs
- ‚úÖ Checks for reserved usernames
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate usernames
- ‚úÖ Enforces format requirements
- ‚úÖ Logs all changes for audit

## Logging for Audit

Keep a record of username changes:

**Template:**
```
Date: 2025-10-06
Ticket: #12345
Current Username: johndoe
New Username: john_official
Reason: User requested rebrand
Changed By: support@createkuji.com
```

## Rollback

To rollback a username change, simply run the script again with reversed arguments:

```bash
# Original change
npm run support:change-username johndoe john_official

# Rollback
npm run support:change-username john_official johndoe
```

## Testing

Before using in production, test with a test account:

```bash
# Create a test user first, then:
npm run support:change-username testuser1 testuser2

# Verify the change
# Then rollback
npm run support:change-username testuser2 testuser1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Run
**Check:**
- Are you in the `server/` directory?
- Is the database running?
- Are environment variables set? (`.env` file)

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check if database is accessible
npm run prisma:generate
```

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Rebuild TypeScript
npm run build
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Method 1: Change by current username
npm run support:change-username <old> <new>

# Method 2: Change by email (for temp usernames)
npm run support:change-username-email <email> <new>

# Examples
npm run support:change-username johndoe john_official
npm run support:change-username-email user@example.com john_official

# Check if successful - look for:
# ‚úÖ Successfully updated username!
# üéâ Username change completed successfully!
```
