# Custom Branding Sync Service Fix

## Problem Identified
The custom branding changes were being saved correctly to LocalForage but not reflected in the UI after clicking "Save Branding". The issue was in the **BrandingContext route logic**.

### Root Cause
The `BrandingContext.jsx` was **only applying branding CSS custom properties** on specific routes:
- `/{username}/draw` (draw pages)
- `/{username}/stock` (stock pages)

However, the `BrandingManager` component is accessed via `/{username}/manage/branding`, which was **not included** in the branding-enabled routes.

This meant:
1. ✅ **Branding data was being saved** correctly to LocalForage
2. ❌ **BrandingContext didn't apply CSS custom properties** on the management page
3. ❌ **Live preview didn't reflect saved changes** because CSS variables weren't set globally

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated BrandingContext Route Logic
**File**: `src/contexts/BrandingContext.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Only match /{username}/draw and /{username}/stock pages
const drawOrStockPattern = /^\/[^/]+\/(draw|stock)$/;
return drawOrStockPattern.test(path);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Apply branding on:
// 1. User-specific draw pages: /{username}/draw
// 2. User-specific stock pages: /{username}/stock  
// 3. Branding management page: /{username}/manage/branding (for live preview)
const brandingRoutes = /^\/[^/]+\/(draw|stock)$|^\/[^/]+\/manage\/branding$/;
return brandingRoutes.test(path);
```

### 2. Enhanced BrandingManager Component
**File**: `src/components/Manage/BrandingManager.jsx`

**Added**:
- **Debug logging**: Console logs to show when CSS custom properties are applied after saving
- **Dual preview system**: 
  - Form data preview (immediate changes while editing)
  - CSS variables preview (shows actual applied branding after saving)
- **Enhanced user feedback**: Better visual indication of what's happening

### 3. Route Pattern Testing
Verified the new regex pattern works correctly:
- ✅ `/demo/draw` - applies branding (draw page)
- ✅ `/demo/stock` - applies branding (stock page)  
- ✅ `/demo/manage/branding` - applies branding (management page for live preview)
- ❌ `/demo/manage/prizes` - doesn't apply branding (other management pages)
- ❌ `/demo/manage` - doesn't apply branding (management root)

## Technical Details

### How Branding Context Works
1. **Route Detection**: `shouldApplyBrandingOnRoute()` checks if current route should have branding
2. **Access Control**: Checks if user's subscription plan includes custom branding
3. **CSS Application**: If both conditions are met, applies branding as CSS custom properties:
   - `--brand-primary`
   - `--brand-secondary` 
   - `--brand-accent`
   - `--brand-font-family`
   - `--brand-bg-pattern`
   - `--brand-bg-image`

### Why This Fix Works
- **Immediate Preview**: Users can now see changes reflected immediately in the "Applied Branding" section after saving
- **Global Application**: CSS custom properties are applied globally on the branding management page
- **No Breaking Changes**: Draw and stock pages continue to work exactly as before
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead - only adds one additional route pattern to check

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- User saves branding → No immediate visual feedback
- Live preview shows form data but not actual applied styles
- Users couldn't tell if branding was actually saved and working

### After Fix  
- User saves branding → Immediate visual feedback in "Applied Branding" section
- Console shows CSS custom properties being applied (for debugging)
- Clear distinction between form preview and actual applied branding
- Users can verify branding is working properly

## Testing
- ✅ Regex pattern validation completed
- ✅ Route logic updated and tested  
- ✅ BrandingContext console logging added for debugging
- ✅ Dual preview system implemented
- ✅ Beta access integration maintained

## Next Steps for Users
1. Navigate to `/{username}/manage/branding`
2. Make branding changes
3. Click "Save Branding"
4. Check the "Applied Branding (CSS Variables)" section to confirm changes are applied
5. Visit your draw page (`/{username}/draw`) to see branding in action

The custom branding should now reflect changes immediately after saving!
