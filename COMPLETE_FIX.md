# Complete Fix for Missing Navigation Links

## The Issue
Navigation links (Draw, Manage, Account) are not showing because of a property name mismatch:
- `AuthContext` exports `loading` 
- Components were using `isLoading` (which doesn't exist)
- This caused the app to get stuck in a loading state

## Files Fixed
1. ‚úÖ `server/src/controllers/authController.ts` - Added `emailVerified` field to API response
2. ‚úÖ `src/components/AuthenticatedHome.jsx` - Changed `isLoading` to `loading`
3. ‚úÖ `src/components/UserRoutes.jsx` - Changed `isLoading` to `loading`

## Complete Restart Procedure

### Step 1: Stop ALL Node Processes

```powershell
# Run this command to stop all Node.js processes
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

Wait 3 seconds, then verify they're all stopped:

```powershell
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Should return nothing or say "Cannot find a process".

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

Open a NEW PowerShell terminal and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\k.koh\dev\create-kuji-app\server
npm run dev
```

Wait until you see:
```
üöÄ Create Kuji Server running on port 3001
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend Server

Open ANOTHER NEW PowerShell terminal and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\k.koh\dev\create-kuji-app
npm run dev
```

Wait until you see:
```
VITE vX.X.X  ready in XXX ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache

1. Open your browser at http://localhost:5173
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

OR do a hard refresh:
- **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Chrome/Edge)
- **Ctrl + F5** (Firefox)

### Step 5: Clear Authentication Data (if still broken)

If the page is still blank after steps 1-4, clear your authentication data:

1. Open browser at http://localhost:5173
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Run this command:

```javascript
localStorage.clear(); indexedDB.deleteDatabase('localforage'); location.reload();
```

This will log you out and reload the page. You'll need to log in again.

### Step 6: Log In and Verify

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. You should see the login page
3. Log in with your credentials
4. You should be redirected to `/{username}/manage`
5. **Check that you see navigation links**: Draw, Manage, Account

## Expected Result

After following these steps, you should see:

‚úÖ Navigation links in the header (Draw, Manage, Account)
‚úÖ User dropdown on the top right
‚úÖ Language selector
‚úÖ The page content loads properly

## If Still Not Working

If the navigation links STILL don't appear after following all steps:

1. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
2. Look for these debug messages:

```
=== MainLayout Debug ===
user object: {id: "...", username: "...", ...}
user exists? true
usernameSetByUser: true
emailVerified: true
Should show nav links? true
========================
```

3. If you see `user object: null`, the authentication is not working
4. If you see `emailVerified: undefined`, the backend fix didn't apply

Take a screenshot of the console output and we can diagnose further.

## Quick Verification Command

Run this in PowerShell to verify both servers are running:

```powershell
# Check backend
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check frontend
curl http://localhost:5173
```

Both should return responses without errors.

## Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Not stopping ALL node processes** - This leaves old servers running
‚ùå **Not clearing browser cache** - Old JavaScript is still loaded
‚ùå **Not waiting for servers to fully start** - Connecting too early causes errors
‚ùå **Not clearing authentication data** - Old user data structure causes issues

## Summary

The root cause was a property name mismatch (`loading` vs `isLoading`) that prevented the app from properly detecting when authentication was complete, causing it to never show the navigation links.

The fix involved:
1. Correcting the property names
2. Adding the missing `emailVerified` field to the API
3. Properly restarting both servers
4. Clearing browser cache
