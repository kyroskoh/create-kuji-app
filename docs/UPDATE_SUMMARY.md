# Update Summary - Session Controls & Demo User Pro Plan

## Overview
This document summarizes the updates made to improve session controls documentation and set the demo user to Pro plan.

---

## 1. Demo User Pro Plan Configuration

### Changes Made

**Problem:** All users (including demo) were defaulting to "free" plan, but we wanted demo users to showcase Pro features.

**Solution:** 
- Default plan remains "free" for all users
- Demo user is specifically set to "pro" plan upon login

### Implementation Details

#### Default Settings (`src/hooks/useLocalStorageDAO.js`)
```javascript
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
  // ... other settings
  subscriptionPlan: "free" // Default plan for all users
};
```

#### Demo User Login (`src/pages/Demo.jsx`)
```javascript
const handleDemoLogin = async (user) => {
  const result = await login(user.username, user.password, false);
  
  if (result.success) {
    // Set demo user to Pro plan
    if (user.username === 'demo') {
      const currentSettings = await getSettings();
      await setSettings({
        ...currentSettings,
        subscriptionPlan: 'pro'
      });
    }
    // ... rest of login flow
  }
};
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Demo users can showcase all Pro features
- ✅ New users still start with free plan
- ✅ Clear separation between demo and regular users
- ✅ Easy to test Pro features without payment

## 2. Enhanced Session Controls Documentation

### Changes Made

**Problem:** Session controls (INACTIVE, ACTIVE, PAUSED) lacked clear explanation of their purpose and usage.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive in-context documentation with icons, descriptions, and usage guide.

### New UI Elements

#### 1. Status Icons
Each status now has a visual icon:
- ⏸️ **INACTIVE** - Yellow color
- ✅ **ACTIVE** - Green color
- ⏯️ **PAUSED** - Blue color

#### 2. Tooltip Descriptions
Hovering over buttons shows:
- INACTIVE: "Drawing disabled - Setup mode"
- ACTIVE: "Drawing enabled - Users can draw prizes"
- PAUSED: "Temporarily paused - No draws allowed"

#### 3. Detailed Usage Guide
New collapsible guide section below the status buttons:

```
Session Status Guide:

⏸️ INACTIVE: Use this when setting up your kuji event.
No prizes can be drawn. Perfect for configuring tiers, 
adding prizes, and testing.

✅ ACTIVE: Your kuji event is live!
Users can draw prizes. Switch to this when you're 
ready to start the event.

⏯️ PAUSED: Temporarily stop drawing without ending the session.
Use this for breaks, restocking prizes, or when you 
need to make adjustments.

💡 Tip: Always start with INACTIVE to set up your event safely.
Switch to ACTIVE when ready, and use PAUSED for temporary breaks.
```

### Visual Improvements

**Before:**
```
Session Controls
[INACTIVE] [ACTIVE] [PAUSED]
```

**After:**
```
Session Controls
Control your kuji drawing session state. Use these to manage when prizes can be drawn.

[⏸️ INACTIVE] [✅ ACTIVE] [⏯️ PAUSED]

## 10. Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: Why does demo user get Pro plan but I don't?**
- A: Demo users are special showcase accounts. Regular users start with free plan and can upgrade.

**Q: What happens if I change status during an active draw?**
- A: Current draw completes, new status applies to next draw.

**Q: Can I switch between statuses anytime?**
- A: Yes! You have full control over session status at any time.

**Q: Will PAUSED affect my prizes?**
- A: No, prizes and data are preserved. PAUSED only stops new draws.

**Q: How do I know which status I'm in?**
- A: The highlighted button shows current status. Also check the session indicator on draw page.
