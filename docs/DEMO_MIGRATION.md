# Demo Page Migration to Dynamic Stock Page

## Overview
Migrated the hardcoded `/demo` and `/demo/stock` pages to use the dynamic `/:username/stock` page with the `demo` user.

---

## Why This Change?

### Before:
- **Hardcoded Demo Page** - Separate `Demo.jsx` and `DemoStock.jsx` components
- **Free Plan** - Demo user was on free plan, couldn't showcase Pro features
- **Unpublished Stock** - Stock page wasn't published
- **Duplicate Code** - Had to maintain two stock page implementations

### After:
- **Dynamic Page** - Uses the same `/:username/stock` page as all users
- **Pro Plan** - Demo user upgraded to Pro to showcase all features
- **Published Stock** - Stock page is now public and accessible
- **Single Codebase** - Easier maintenance and consistent experience

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Updates ‚úÖ

**Upgraded demo user to Pro plan:**
```bash
npm run fix:demo-plan
```

**Published demo stock page:**
```bash
npm run fix:publish-demo-stock
```

**Demo user now has:**
- `subscriptionPlan: 'pro'` - Full feature access
- `sessionStatus: 'PUBLISHED'` - Stock page is public

---

### 2. Frontend Updates ‚úÖ

**Updated `App.jsx`:**

**Removed:**
```jsx
import Demo from "./pages/Demo.jsx";
import DemoStock from "./pages/DemoStock.jsx";
// ...
<Route path="/demo" element={<Demo />} />
<Route path="/demo/stock" element={<DemoStock />} />
```

**Added:**
```jsx
{/* Redirect old demo route to new dynamic demo stock page */}
<Route path="/demo" element={<Navigate to="/demo/stock" replace />} />
```

Now `/demo` redirects to `/demo/stock`, which is handled by the dynamic `/:username/stock` route.

---

### 3. Files That Can Be Deleted (Optional)

These files are no longer used:
- `src/pages/Demo.jsx` - Old hardcoded demo page
- `src/pages/DemoStock.jsx` - Old hardcoded demo stock page

**Note:** Keep them for now in case you want to reference the old implementation.

---

## URL Mapping

| Old URL | New URL | Handled By |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `/demo` | `/demo/stock` | Redirect ‚Üí `/:username/stock` |
| `/demo/stock` | `/demo/stock` | `/:username/stock` (dynamic) |

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Consistent Experience**
- Demo uses the same page as real users
- Any improvements to stock page automatically apply to demo

### 2. **Showcase Pro Features**
- Demo now has Pro plan
- Shows analytics, custom branding, all tier colors, etc.

### 3. **Published Stock**
- Demo stock is public and always accessible
- Visitors can see real-time stock without login

### 4. **Easier Maintenance**
- Only one stock page implementation
- No duplicate code to update

### 5. **Easier Reproduction**
- Demo behaves exactly like a real user
- Bugs in demo = bugs in production

---

## Testing

### Verify the migration works:

1. **Test redirect:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5173/demo
   Should redirect to: http://localhost:5173/demo/stock
   ```

2. **Test stock page:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:5173/demo/stock
   Should show: Dynamic stock page for demo user
   ```

3. **Verify Pro features:**
   - Check demo can access all tier colors
   - Verify analytics tab appears
   - Confirm branding options available

4. **Test from homepage:**
   - Click "Try Live Demo" button
   - Should redirect to `/demo/stock`
   - Stock page should load

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. **Restore routes in `App.jsx`:**
   ```jsx
   import Demo from "./pages/Demo.jsx";
   import DemoStock from "./pages/DemoStock.jsx";
   
   <Route path="/demo" element={<Demo />} />
   <Route path="/demo/stock" element={<DemoStock />} />
   ```

2. **Unpublish demo stock (if needed):**
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_settings 
   SET session_status = 'INACTIVE' 
   WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'demo');
   ```

3. **Downgrade demo to free (if needed):**
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_settings 
   SET subscription_plan = 'free' 
   WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'demo');
   ```

## Configuration Summary

### Demo User Settings:
- **Username:** `demo`
- **Plan:** `pro`
- **Stock Status:** `PUBLISHED`
- **Analytics:** ‚úÖ Enabled
- **Custom Branding:** ‚úÖ Enabled

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test the demo page thoroughly
2. ‚úÖ Add some demo data (prizes, draws) to showcase features
3. ‚úÖ Optionally apply custom branding to demo for visual appeal
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Monitor for any issues
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Delete old `Demo.jsx` and `DemoStock.jsx` files once confirmed working
